It can do more than you might think, so let me share how I\u0026rsquo;ve made it useful for privacy, automation, and entertainment without getting too techy.\nBlocking Annoying Ads and Trackers with AdGuard Home # I installed AdGuard Home on my Raspberry Pi to stop those annoying ads and trackers from bothering my devices on the home Wi-Fi. It\u0026rsquo;s like a bouncer for your internet. If you want to set it up, just follow the steps in this guide: AdGuard Home Guide. And, for extra blocking power, check out the filter list at oisd.nl.\nMaking Non-HomeKit Devices Play Nice with HomeBridge # My Philips Wiz lights (Bulb \u0026amp; Batten) weren\u0026rsquo;t playing nice with my Apple stuff, but I found a workaround. I used something called HomeBridge on the Raspberry Pi, which basically acts like a translator between non-HomeKit devices and Apple devices. You can set it up with the help of this guide: HomeBridge Guide.\nCreating Your Personal Entertainment Hub with Plex # Turned my Raspberry Pi into a mini Netflix at home using Plex Media Server. Now, I can watch my favorite shows, movies, and listen to music on any device at home. You can set it up too by following this guide: Plex Media Server Guide.\nTurning LED Strips On and Off with the Raspberry Pi # My LED strips didn\u0026rsquo;t come with a remote, so I got creative. Connected them to the Raspberry Pi and set up a way to turn them on and off using Shortcut App on my Apple devices to run script over SSH. It\u0026rsquo;s not as complicated as it sounds. Here are the SSH commands:\nTo turn it on echo password | sudo -S uhubctl -l 2 -a 1 To turn it off echo password | sudo -S uhubctl -l 2 -a 0\nUsing Raspberry Pi as a Bridge Between Mobile and Router # In the past, there were no wired internet connections in my area. So, I came up with a solution using the Raspberry Pi. I connected my mobile and the router through the Pi, bringing internet access everywhere at home. If you want to know more about how I did it, check out this solution on Stack Overflow.\nConclusion # So, there you have it. Your Raspberry Pi can do a lot for you at home, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a tech genius to set these things up. Give it a try and make the most of your little helper!\n","date":"2023-11-13","permalink":"/blog/20231113-raspberrypi/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Ever since I got my Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM in January 2020, it\u0026rsquo;s been a reliable helper at home.","title":"My Pi Setup: What's Installed?"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/raspberrypi/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"raspberrypi"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tech"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;d like to explore the articles I find intriguing, I\u0026rsquo;ve curated them on a dedicated page using Raindrop.io\u0026rsquo;s collections feature.
